### Project 1: Euros 2024 Analysis
- **Description:**
  This project involves analyzing data from the Euros 2024 tournament, including **web scraping**, **data transformation**, and storing the data in a database. Building upon McKay Johns' tutorial, I extended it by creating a **Streamlit app** to visualize player shots and goals dynamically.
- **Key Features:**
  - Leveraged **Supabase APIs** and **SQL queries** for dynamic data access.
  - Designed a **shot map** visualization using Matplotlib.
