## Python Projects
### Project 1: Euros 2024
- **Description:** In this project, I analyze data from the Euros 2024 tournament. The project includes web scraping, data transformation, and storing the data in a database. This work is based on the tutorial from McKay Johns' course. [Course](https://mckay-s-site.thinkific.com)
- **Link to Code:** [Euros 2024](https://github.com/probablyvivek/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/Python-Projects/Euros)

After getting the data into supabase, I decided to create a streamlit app for all the shots and goals taken by the players of each team.
The app used supbase APIs and SQL queries to fetch the data and create the shot map using matplotlib.

### Project 2: Olympics
- **Description:** This is an analysis of the whole of Summer Olympics Data till 2020 Tokyo Olympics. After the exploration, I created a streamlit app to have an easy access of the data for anyone interested.
- **Link to Code:** [Olympics](https://github.com/probablyvivek/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/Python-Projects/Olympics)

Here is the app : [The Summer Olympics Dashboard](https://summerolympics.streamlit.app/)

### Project 3: Pokemon Data Analysis
- **Description:** This is an analysis of Pokemon Data from a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon)

## SQL Projects

For SQL, I will be going through the following [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4&t=668s) video from Freecodecamp's Channel. And then we will go through the Leet Code SQL problems one by one.
