## SQL Projects

### Project 1: PGExercises
- **Description:**
  A hands-on learning project focusing on SQL mastery using the **PGExercises** platform. Includes foundational and advanced query practice, covering topics such as data retrieval, aggregations, and nested subqueries.
- **Learning Approach:**
  1. **PostgreSQL Setup:**
     - Installed PostgreSQL using `brew install postgresql@15`.
     - Created practice tables using [PG Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/gettingstarted.html).
  2. **Query Practice:**
     - Began with [Basic SQL Questions](https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic/) to solidify core concepts.
     - Progressed to complex problems, including joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
- **Links:**
  - [PGExercises Repository](https://github.com/probablyvivek/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL-Projects/PGExercises)
