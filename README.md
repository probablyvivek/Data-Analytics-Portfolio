## Python Projects
### Project 1: Sports Data Analysis
- **Description:** In this project, I analyze data from the Euros 2024 tournament. The project includes web scraping, data transformation, and storing the data in a database. This work is based on the tutorial from McKay Johns' course. [Course](https://mckay-s-site.thinkific.com) 
- **Link to Code:** [Sport Data Analysis](https://github.com/probablyvivek/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/main/Python-Projects/Sports-Data-Analysis)

After getting the data into supabase, I decided to create a streamlit app for all the shots and goals taken by the players of each team.
The app used supbase APIs and SQL queries to fetch the data and create the shot map using matplotlib.
